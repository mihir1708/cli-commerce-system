Notes
- We coordinated via short task tickets and pair reviews on shared changes.
- Times are estimates; replace bracketed values with actuals if needed.
 - We used a lightweight Git workflow: feature branches, frequent commits, short PRs with summaries, peer review, and resolving review comments before merging.
